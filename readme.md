# circuitpython_tools

```
âžœ cpt -h
Collection of tools to make working with CircuitPython boards easier.

Usage:
circuitpython_tools.sh -h       # show this message
circuitpython_tools.sh open     # open USB device in Finder
circuitpython_tools.sh build    # make _build folder, ready for deployment
circuitpython_tools.sh deploy   # actually deploy ^ to device
circuitpython_tools.sh watch    # watch for changes to automatically build and deploy
circuitpython_tools.sh serial   # connect to device's serial console
circuitpython_tools.sh eject    # eject/unmount USB drive so it can be unplugged

To get smaller build files, install mpy-cross and expose it to cpt:
export CPT_MPY_CROSS="/path/to/mpy-cross"
```

This is a work-in-progress and much of it is OSX-specific.

## Installation

Download with git:

```bash
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:rocktronica/circuitpython_tools.git
```

And then expose it in your bash profile.

``` bash
alias cpt="~/circuitpython_tools/circuitpython_tools.sh"
```

### mpy-cross

cpt is meant to be used in tandem with `mpy-cross`, a compiler that converts Python's `.py` files into much smaller `.mpy` files. For that, follow [Adafruit's installation instructions](https://learn.adafruit.com/building-circuitpython/build-circuitpython) and then export it as `CPT_MPY_CROSS` alongside the `cpt alias` from above.

Mine looks like this, but yours may differ based on where you've installed stuff:

``` bash
export CPT_MPY_CROSS="~/circuitpython/mpy-cross/mpy-cross"
alias cpt="~/circuitpython_tools/circuitpython_tools.sh"
```

If cpt can't find `CPT_MPY_CROSS`, it skips compilation and simply copies your original `.py` files over.

## Usage

Use the `cpt` alias in the same folder where you keep your `main.py` and `lib` folder.

```bash
cd ~/my-cool-project

cpt watch
```

cpt will watch for any changes you make locally to your Python files and automatically compile and deploy them to the device.

## TODO

* work with both `code.py` and `main.py`
* expose rsync's dry-run or some way to confirm deployment changes w/o actually affecting device
